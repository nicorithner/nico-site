# My first portfolio Project 2021
## Iteration 1

### Overview

A simple portfolio project using React.js

The goal of this project is to create my first React app from scratch while setting up a site to show my recent work.

This project challenged me to learn new skills and improve on others. Completing this iteration - iteration 1 - made me realize how much needs to be added to this site so it truly performs at professional level. 
Things coming to mind are:

  - Add dynamic text update to the projects descriptions
  - Add modals to see the photos more clearly zoomed in a pop up.
  - Add a contact form with captcha
  - Creating more components out of the current functionality where I am repeating code.

### Tech Specs

- React:  using `create-react-app`

- npm 7.7.6

### Deployment

- AWS Amplify [www.nicorithner.com](https://www.nicorithner.com)
